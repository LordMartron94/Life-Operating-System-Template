What does *Nizam Tashghil Alhayaa* (ŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ©) stand for? It means *Life Operating System* in Arabic. The story behind this is that I got inspired for the use of Arabic language while watching Season 3 of Arrow.

This public vault is the template of my ultimate Life Operating System -- The location from which you manage all areas of your life. It will continuously adapt and change based on further experience and knowledge.

As of this moment it is based on my 5+ years of productivity experience and knowledge. The many valuable insights I have gotten in this area stem from creators such as *David Allen*, *Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi*, *[[August Bradley]]*, *Dan Koe*, *Thomas Frank*, and *Dr. Benjamin Hardy*.

This "project" is a way for me to synthesize and consolidate everything I have learned so far while also motivating me tremendously to keep being engaged with the system; as it is one of my own makings. 
	Does this make it *originally* mine? I argue it would, even though I use many pieces of knowledge and concepts from many authors; science is a process of contrasting, comparing, and synthezing; the unique connections one makes is what makes the work original. Something cannot be truly original, based on nothing; this is impossible.

The creation of this system is also my own "10X" project... Not entirely, as the project is too simple and short to truly be 10X, but it moves the needle for my life a lot that I dub it a 10X project. Just keep in mind it is not truly 10X.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Prior Note
> [!important]
> The current version of this system and vault is still **ALPHA**...
> Certain integrations and syntheses are not yet done seemlessly/harmoniously. They will be upon further use of the system and reflection on it. In other words, in future versions.

> If you want to help me with the iterative process of optimizing this system for managing life... Do the following:
> Keep a daily log for usage of the system according to the following template: [[System Usage Log Template]], then after a month's worth of logging, write up a document summarizing your findings and send that to me on Discord (mr.hoornasp.learningexpert) or through email: md.career@protonmail.com


## üìñ Background Knowledge
In this system, I will synthesize my knowledge from a multitude of sources and a plethora of mentors. For a complete list of sources, see [[Bibliography for the System|the bibliography]].

At its core, the system is based on [[Getting Things Done]] by [[David Allen]] and [[PPV]] (Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults) by [[August Bradley]]. Additionally, I will incorporate elements from [[10X is Easier than 2X]] by [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]], [[John Boyd]]'s OODA loop, and more.

The entire purpose of the system is to *ensure* that everything you do is in line with what you actually want to achieve... To make it almost *effortless* to manage all areas of your life on a **consistent** basis. As August would say, to have a complete system for **FOCUS** and **ALIGNMENT**.

This system will help you (through habit and methodology) from your *anti-vision* to your ultimate *vision*.

## üó∫Ô∏è Map
Read this first: [[What is Contained In this Vault]]

Important general help pages:
- [[Options in Metadata]] -- When you don't know which options to fill in for a field in a template.
- [[Taxonomy]] -- For overall guidance into the system.

You will mostly be interacting with the system (as the start of navigation) through the [[Home|Command Center]] page.

### Mentors
In the folder `0500 Mentors and Guides` is a collection of people who inspired me to build this system--or where I got the most valuable insights from in order to create this system.
Within each person's "note" you can find a short introduction about the person and where to find them on the internet.

**Some additional thanks to:**
- *Muhammed Ali* -- for answering my weird shizzle questions for technical Obsidian

### Guiding Steps
In order to make use of this system as effectively as possible, a few guiding steps have made its way to existence.

These steps are based on the concept of [[Narrowing Horizons as a System Design Principle|narrowing horizons]].

1. [[Figure out your True North]]
2. [[Formulate your 100X Vision]]
3. [[Decide upon your Goals]]
4. [[Create a few starting Projects]]

Guidance through example: [[Examples]]
