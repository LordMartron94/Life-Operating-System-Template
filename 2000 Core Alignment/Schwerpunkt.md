# [[Schwerpunkt]]
> [!info]
> The Schwerpunkt is a concept from the art of war, particularly during the German Blitzkrieg assaults (a type of strategy). It was explained by colonel and strategist John Boyd. Basically, the Schwerpunkt is the primary *objective* of which you should never lose sight. When soldiers would lose sight of the schwerpunkt, battles would be lost.
> 
In terms of the Life OS and alignment in general, your schwerpunkt is your primary objective/purpose for a period. The duration of this period can differ depending on the objective. The schwerpunkt can also be replaced by another if it would become more important.
> 
> An example could be: **Schwerpunkt: Get back into productivity**
> Or: **Schwerpunkt: Fix Sleep**
> These are mostly short term examples...
> 
> A longer term example could be: **Schwerpunkt: Finish Publishing Book on Learning Efficiently**

### OBJECTIVES:
*Objectives are your goals, projects, etc., transformed into a statement line (you can also just link it to the page).*

```ad-info
ðŸ’¡ Itâ€™s useful to determine the _amount_ of active goal outcomes based on **time availability**. While going to school, I recommend to have:
- One goal where you must spend a LOT of time on â€” preferably based on the Schwerpunkt
- One goal to spend a moderate amount of time on
- One goal to spend a minimal amount of time on

Ideally these goals are determined based on **impact**â€”**signifance**â€”towards the totality of your life.
