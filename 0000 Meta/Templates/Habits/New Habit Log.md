## Breaking Bad Habit
> Awareness is the first step towards breaking any habit.

```ad-important
Only fill these things in if this is a habit you want to break, it’s far less effective for habits you want to build. Also fill this in when you succeeded to not do your bad habit this day because it might create a contrast between “good” and “bad” days during reflection. Be sure to signify that it’s a good day though.
```
