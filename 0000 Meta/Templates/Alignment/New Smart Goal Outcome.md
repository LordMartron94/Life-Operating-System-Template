## Goal Anchoring
The first step in the creation of an outcome goal is to anchor it, to define it adequately.
The goal should be SMART.
```ad-info
title: SMART
collapse: closed
**S**pecific
**M**easurable
**A**chievable
**R**ealistic
**T**imebound
```

Lorem ipsum (write here).

### Why this Goal?
%% Paste this into the `why this goal` field in the metadata. %%
*In this section you shall answer why you have this goal outcome... Why is it important to you? Why is it relevant? How does this help you become who you want to become? What values of yours does it serve? How significant is the goal? Is it important at all?*

Lorem ipsum (write here).

## Goal Determination
*How much input-time will it likely require to accomplish this goal? Something can take many months, but only a minimal amount of time to invest on a day-to-day, week-to-week, basisâ€”this is what I am talking about here.*
