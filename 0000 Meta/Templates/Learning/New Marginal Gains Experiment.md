## Reflection (after experiment)
```ad-important
Make sure to have this aid in the "how did it go?" and "what made it easier/harder" fields.
```
- *Why did I think the experiment would succeed? What presented itself in my mind to convince me?*
- *Why didnâ€™t it go as expected?*
- *What limiting habit is part of this?*
- *What did I learn about my knowledge, understanding, perspective, or execution?*
- *Did I develop a deeper understanding of the process by doing this?*
- *Did I realize there are things I had overlooked?* **(very common)**
