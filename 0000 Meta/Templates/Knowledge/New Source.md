## Inspectional Reading

### Introduction
I endeavor to create this document because I desired a way to keep track of all my book inspections; I have a system for keeping all my books at the appropriate place on their shelves and in the house based on the content of the book and my own interaction with such topics. This way of organizing my books works extraordinarily well, with one caveat: I cannot put a book at its appropriate place without having an idea about the book’s contents. For instance, I made the mistake of putting Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s _The Black Swan_ under philosophy, after a quick glance, whilst, after reading the book, I found out the book actually would belong under science.
	My system actually does not use topics such as “philosophy” and “science” as this would mean I would need to have a static system which does not account for collections of any size. Instead, I opted for something a bit more generic. I created the division of non-fiction and fiction, and roughly 10 subcategories beneath NF at first. For example, 1a would account for Non-Fiction (1)/Education and Learning (a). 1b would be Non-Fiction (1)/Productivity.
	These ten main categories are sorted based on my number of interactions with the category, where the ones closest to me are also first on the shelves.
	After the initial coding I sort based on author last name (first three letters) which I also encode in numbers, because it’s easier to see if a number is after another than for a letter.
	For instance, Scheper (Sch) would become 19.3.8.
	In the instance that such a label would become quite full (if there are for example a few dozen books in the 1a category), I would subdivide it into more specific and granular categories. I would then get for example 1b1 (NF/Productivity/Time Management). Each layer will be a little (not too much) more specific than its predecessor.
	Organizing my books in this manner creates an organic system suited to collections of virtually any size.

The solution to this is to systematically read a book preliminarily before putting it on my shelf. This does not entail to read the book front-to-back very deeply. Rather I make use of certain features of a book (its index, table of contents, etc.) and maybe read a few paragraphs here and there.
	Considering the amount of books I read this might still take a while, lol.


Just like with pre-studying, the goal is not to get to know the book’s contents, or learn it, but rather to gain a sense of _how to think about the book._ You build a cognitive framework from which you look at the subject matter.

Adler and van Doren, in their extraordinary book _How to Read a Book_ dub this concept _Inspectional Reading_ and provide a system for performing this aspect of reading a book. Naturally, this is the foundation for this document. However, I will not avoid using my knowledge of learning science, in particular Cognitive Load Theory and Inquiry-Based Learning.

### Template

#### Systematic Skimming
- [ ] Read the Title & Preface (if the book has one)
	- Note to self: Important to spend here some time on actually *reflecting*.
- [ ] Inspect the Table of Contents
	- If the authors have made a comprehensive and high-quality table of contents, it’s often a very valuable blueprint for the book.
	- Note to self: Important to spend here some time on actually *reflecting*.
- [ ] Check the Index
    - Usually, the terms with the most referenced pages are the most important.
        - You might want to read a few of the referenced pages for important terms, just to get an idea of what the author is trying to say.
        - Based on the Index, you can make an educated guess about how familiar you are with the work, as more familiar terms means you know more.
- [ ] If the book is a newer edition to an old written book, check out the publisher’s blurb rather quickly.
- [ ] Read the summary statements of chapters that seem pivotal to the author’s argument _carefully_.
- [ ] Read a few pages here and there, never more than a few in sequence—and never fail to read the last 3 pages of the main part of the book, as most authors can’t resist to sum up their arguments.
- [ ] Find out a bit about who the author is (through Google and other means), what is their credibility? What is their area of research? Etc.
#### Superficial Reading
For time efficiency, this superficial reading is only advised to do if the book’s substance you are trying to read is (far) ahead of your level…

We want to read the entire book once, without getting bogged down on details, skipping what we don’t know. Its goal is to gain a better understanding of the unity of the book—which is crucial for understanding the book. In other words: to avoid not being able to see the forest because of the trees.

A book where I would do this, for example, would be one authored by Luhmann or Hegel, or anything of the like.

#### Questions to Answer After Inspection
1. **What is the overall structure and organization of the book?** Again, very broadly and briefly. Just to give a general sense.
Lorem ipsum.
2. **What are the main topics or themes discussed in the book?**
Lorem ipsum.
3. **What is the author's main argument or thesis?** State this briefly.
Lorem ipsum.
4. **What is the writing style or tone used by the author?**
Lorem ipsum.
5. **How would you classify the book?** This is not as straight forward as distinguishing fiction from non-fiction, but rather to distinguish multiple forms of expository works from each other (those that intend to convey knowledge).
    1. **Is this book theoretical or practical in nature?** Does it intend to tell you _how_ to do something, or _what_ is the case? Or is there a degree of both?
    2. **Is the book science, philosophy, history, or math, etc.?** Of course, there can be a degree of multiple, just like with theory vs practice.
    3. **Any other pigeonholes this book would fall into?**
Lorem ipsum.

### Introduction
The reader may want to use this template when he wants to increase the chances of his learned knowledge going into his long-term memory. He may also want to use this template if he wants to improve the quality of his book recommendations to friends and family, and prevent the following piece of dialogue:

- Reader: “Mom, you should read this book! It’s so good.”
- Mom: “Why?”
- Reader: “It’s a good book…”
- Mom: “That doesn’t tell me why I should read this book, why should I read it?”
- Reader: “Euhm… [thinking] You know, it’s a good book, it’s about reading a book well.”
- Mom: “Yeah that’s what the title says, but what have you learned? Can you give me a summary of the book?”
- Reader: Scratches head and walks away…

The previous dialogue is highly inspired by an example Nishant Kasibhatla gave in one of his inspirational talks.

The reader may not want to use this template if the reader is reading for leisure, fiction or pleasure in general, or when he is reading for information as opposed to enlightenment or understanding. The difference between the latter and former as explained by Adler is the following: reading for information is when the reader has a specific question, or set of questions, for the book to answer which are usually simplistic in nature and do not require a lot of thought whereas reading for understanding or enlightenment is for the reader to extend the limits of his knowledge and requires deep thought and analysis of the material, it mutates the cognitive schemas and can even turn the reader’s world on his head, provided the right substance.

Note that this is a translation of what the author said into my own words without losing the essence (this is different from paraphrasing). For those who wonder, the authors specifically distinguish between the two reading goals in terms of intelligibility; if what you read is understandable by you immediately but you did not know the knowledge beforehand, you have acquired new _information,_ however, when you read something and do not understand it immediately, and also not knew the information beforehand, you have acquired _knowledge._ You have extended either the breadth or depth of your _understanding_. Should it turn your world on its head and alter your worldview to a significant degree, you have gained _enlightenment_..

The reader may also not want to use this template if he is lazy or not resilient. Gaining more understanding, or enlightening oneself, requires deep thought, analysis, and learning. And, as Ahrens has said, “the one who does the effort does the learning” . One cannot gain a solid understanding without putting in the effort. As Cognitive Load Theory also indicates, learning is increased tremendously when optimized intrinsic load (working memory devoted to creating and automating cognitive schemas, the models in your head representing your understanding and knowledge of a subject along with its intricate relationships) is high, but not to the point of cognitive overload. Therefore, putting in more effort, the right effort that is, will improve your learning significantly. However, I will not go into much detail on the science of learning, as that is not the point of this document.

#### Template Goal^1
This document is written with as purpose to do the author of a piece of work, non-fiction, well by providing him with a fair and objective analysis of his work. This both gives feedback to the author, should he come into possession of this review, if still alive, as well as serve the reader for it re-encodes his knowledge further into long-term memory through higher-order usage of material, on the analytical and evaluative stages of Bloom’s Taxonomy, either through true recall, from the memory, or with the aid of the source material.

The final benefit is to the community, as it allows potential readers to assess the validity and usefulness of the material for themselves based on objective and sound, as opposed to subjective and illogical, reviews, as far too little of this exists in the modern environment; there are unfortunately countless of examples where a reader criticizes a piece of non-fiction based on subjective reasoning (I do not like what this author says, I do not like how this author writes, etc.) or errors in logic or even claims without argumentation (I do not agree with the author.). This does not serve the author, nor the community, nor even the reader himself; every claim needs to have solid argumentation for it to be worth something and criticizing an expository work should always be about the substance matter itself. However, there are exceptions, as an author’s writing style can be somewhat objectively be assessed with regards to his subject matter, then the argument should become _The author’s style of writing does not suit the subject of his writing,_ instead of the baseless and useless argument _I do not like the way this author writes._

This template is not designed to give an objective rating to a work of non-fiction; however, it can help the reader to objectively determine such a rating. I have created a small Python script that has the function of giving objective ratings to non-fiction between 1 and 5; however, as of this date (04 December 2023) this is not publically available. To be made aware at the very moment this is published, the reader should join Mr. Hoorn’s Company’s Discord server through the following link: [https://discord.gg/cvd8gUdukj](https://discord.gg/cvd8gUdukj). In the occasion that this link is unavailable, the reader can choose to send me an e-mail at [md.career@protonmail.com](mailto:md.vanderhoorn@gmail.com).

^1: It is important to mention that it is virtually impossible to attain perfect objectivity (100%). However, by including very granular review with highly specific descriptions of what each criticism means (primarily in the rating system), the most significant elements of subjectivity have been eliminated.

#### Template Advice
I highly urge the reader to try and fill in the review as well as he can from memory, to aid the consolidation of his knowledge and bring it into long-term memory, and use the source material only when absolutely necessary. Before publishing the review publically, as should be done would the reader not be self-serving, one should still go back through the source material, or one’s former notes, to confirm his review is written correctly and accurately. If the reader is self-serving and keeps his review to himself, one should still go through this step to prevent the miss-encoding of substance through accidental errors. This way of working is partially inspired by the Feynman method and by my own knowledge of learning.

It is up to the reader if he shall follow this carefully written advice based on research.

A final piece of advice is to not fill this template in comprehensively for each and every book. As Adler and van Doren mention, there is such a thing as a book pyramid, you have undemanding books which you can quickly go through (fiction but also some modern non-fiction), demanding books, which require your attention and a careful deep reading, and growth books, which give you new knowledge and enlightenment no matter how many times you carefully read them. You should only review books meticulously (using the template) for the books in the latter two stages, and even then I would advice to make a distinction between books you read out of interest and books you read out of purpose. I only review books this comprehensively when they align with my goals and ambitions, such as books within the education and learning space. You can also fill it in to a degree.

Lastly, should the reader have any questions about either this document’s format, the template, not the review itself, unless it has been written by the template author too, the reader can choose to contact me through one of the ways as defined at the beginning of the document.

#### Template Basis
The majority of this document, as of version 1, is inspired by Adler’s rules for analytical reading. As well as my own knowledge of how learning works based on extensive research, primarily within the Cognitive Load Theory space.

#### Ethics and Other Principles for Book Reviewing
Note that I will only go briefly into each point, only insofar it is necessary for the purposes of this template. If the reader is interested in a more elaborate discussion of the matters being mentioned, I highly recommend him to read Adler’s work.

_Note: See [[Rating a Book Fairly]] for further information on how to rate a book, and how all these things come together._

##### Understanding before Criticizing
You must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, ‘I understand,’ before you can say any one of the following things: ‘I agree,’ ‘I disagree,’ or ‘I suspend judgement.’” – (Adler & van Doren, 2014, p. 141) 

For those who are unfamiliar with the term suspending judgement: it means to not be convinced or not be persuaded one way or the other.

Before criticizing the book, you must understand the substance. A lawyer should not judge an internist’s work, just as an internist should not judge a lawyer’s work; that is, unless they have expertise in the other field as well. Understanding comes before judgment, period. The reader does not have to be an expert in the field in order to criticize the subject matter, though it would help, but he definitely needs to understand what the author is saying. Of course, as one reads more and more and a field, or gains more expertise within and becomes more familiar with a field, the judgments he makes about a book become more grounded as the reader can analyze the substance not just within the frame of the book but within the context of all his knowledge. This results in the fact that even though all book criticisms made with these principles, and this template, will be elaborate, reviews made by experts are in all scenarios more valuable in accurately assessing a book. Another way of saying this is that the value of a book review made by this template, or these principles, is a function of the reader’s expertise within the subject matter and his expertise with reading intelligently in general. One cannot make a valuable assessment without good reading skills.

Even so, remember that an objective and logical review by a beginner is far better than a subjective and illogical review by anyone else, expert or not.

###### On Interdependent Works
As the authors note in the book (Adler & van Doren, 2014, p. 143) , there are certain cases where criticism is either extremely difficult or outright impossible to do in a sensible manner. Assuming the reader is fair and only criticizes after understanding the substance, one should not try to criticize the book if the reader has only read (and understood) part of the book. It is hard to understand the part of a whole without understanding the whole, which often is larger than the sum of its parts in a good book; therefore, the entirety of the book should be read and understood before attempting to judge the work. However, there are exceptions, there are certain books with chapters that are understandable completely in isolation, without any reference to each other whatsoever, but in my experience (I have read over 140 books in my lifetime so far) these are pretty rare.

Another case in which the reader should be very careful to criticize a work, or even say he truly understands it, is if the author references either a lot of his own other works or that of other authors. A crucial point must be made here; in most academic works, and some normal expository books for the general audience, a lot of citations are present, but one certainly does not need to have read and understood all of them to understand the present matter. The references that matter must be those that make the current work unintelligible to a significant degree without knowing the cited work. An obvious example of this is Niklas Luhmann’s works; he wrote in a non-linear fashion, and nearly all of his works reference other works by him or even implicitly assume the reader is familiar with them. Therefore, to say one understands a single of his works is preposterous prior to understanding all of his works. As has been said by scholars of Luhmann (forgive me for not finding my source), one can start anywhere with his works but understand nothing until they have read every work at least once. So, one should only start to criticize such works when the appropriate references have been understood in addition to the present work.

##### Criticize to Find Truth
“_Respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by giving reasons for any critical judgment you make.” – (Adler & van Doren, 2014, p. 148)_

It should be rather obvious, but the point of criticizing an author or his work is to learn and find truth, or common ground. The goal is not, and should not be, to show one’s own expertise and boost one’s ego, or to win for the sake of winning. Don’t argue for the sake of arguing. Intellectual honesty, and honesty to oneself, is demanded in order to gain something out of the discussion for all sides. As Adler and van Doren rightly state, “[The reader] should be as prepared to agree as to disagree.” . Agreeing or disagreeing, or suspending judgment, with an author is not subjective; it is dependent on the soundness of his logic. When everything he says is correct, the reader is _forced_ to agree, whether he likes it or not.

#### The Points of Objective Criticism
As has previously been mentioned, remember that for each of these points, appropriate reasoning must be given (preferably with quotations and page numbers). Claims without reasoning are foolish and unethical.

_Irrelevant to the review itself, but crucial for objectively rating a book, I will provide the weights I have assigned each point to contribute to the final rating, which is part of my script mentioned earlier. This calculation will not be final, and the factors might change, but it will at least be something. Regardless, I urge the ethical reader to join my Discord server to immediately gain access to the free rating script when it is finished and becomes available._

_At this point in time, the 4th_ _of December 2023, the weights are as follows:_

- Clarity: 0.3
- Logic: 0.3
- Misinformed: 0.15
- Analysis: 0.135
- Uninformed: 0.115

_As said, these weights are not final, and are subject to change. But at this point in time, these give me the most logical and fair ratings. How these weights are used I will explain later. An explanation for this distribution will be added to the document at a later time._

##### The Author’s Soundness
###### The Author is Uninformed
Saying that an author is uninformed is to say that the work lacked some piece of information that is relevant to the point the author is trying to make or the problem he is trying to solve. If this information is irrelevant, there is of course no use to making this claim, so refrain from it to not confuse those who read your review, and your future self. To support this argument, you as reader must be able to provide the knowledge, how it is relevant, and how it would make a difference to his conclusions.

Now, it is worth mentioning that for this uninformedness (yes, I am aware this is not a real word) to be fair, it should take into consideration the period in which the author lived and his circumstances. For example, judging a medical book from the middle ages on the merit of modern medical findings would not be fair to the author as he had no way of knowing this. In a scenario such as this, you can mention the information is outdated, but it should not influence your overall review of the book or your rating.

*Note: it seems that Adler & van Doren are making the same argument as they briefly mention this scenario, but I am not sure. If they make this point, it is not explicit. (Adler & van Doren, 2014, p. 155)*

###### The Author is Misinformed
To say that an author is misinformed, is to claim that he asserts something which is not the case; for example, he claims something is true while it is, in fact, false, or he assumes something is more probable while it is less probable. Of course, such a conclusion may be due to a lack of knowledge (he is uninformed) but it is more than that, for otherwise it would not have a separate category.

To fairly make this criticism, the reader must be able to give arguments for why the author is wrong in a certain instance. Once again here, the author must have had the possibility to have acquired this knowledge, for otherwise it is not the author’s mistake.

###### The Author is Illogical
When the author is illogical, he is making flaws in his reasoning. For example, he makes a conclusion that cannot be drawn from the reasons given, or he gives two arguments or claims that are incompatible with each other. The reader must be able to point out where this is the case.

I urge the reader to do more research into logic and errors of reasoning. I can recommend Mark Forsyth’s _The Elements of Eloquence_ and Marcus Tullius Cicero’s _How to Win an Argument,_ which, by the way, is a misleading title, as the book is about more than that.

As with all other points, the matters in case must be relevant to the point the author is making or the problem he is trying to solve. It does not matter if the author is illogical in irrelevant matters.

###### It is now Time to Agree
At this point, you have to agree with the author. That is, if, so far, you have not been able to _show_ that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or illogical in relevant scenarios. It does not matter whether he is _right_ or _wrong_ objectively, as you can’t know this. Perhaps upon reading a later book, you make the discovery he was misinformed or uninformed about certain matters, then you can alter your perspective. The intellectually sensible mind is never made from stone, but rather from clay, and can be molded into any form based on thought and readings.

Of course, if you are reading an older book, and the author is indeed uninformed or misinformed in relevant aspects, but he couldn’t have known it, as with the medical book from the middle ages, would not make you have to agree, even though the points in case were not valid for sensible criticism.

###### The Author’s Analysis is Incomplete
When you say that an author’s analysis is incomplete, you are saying that he has not solved all the problems he started with, or has not made the most effective use of the materials he had at his disposal, that he did not see all their implications, or that he has failed to make distinctions that are relevant to his work.

Once again, for this point to be valid, the reader must be able to point out where exactly the book is inadequate.

##### The Clarity of the Work^2
It is worth mentioning that Adler & van Doren do not include this in their framework for reviewing a book. I do, because clarity is a significant contribution to the intelligibility and usefulness of a book. If a book is logical, accurate (no misinformedness and no uninformedness) and its analysis is complete, yet the clarity is very low, it is super difficult to read, the book’s objective value should decrease significantly, though not to the point of being worth nothing.

I have also given weightings to the individual points within the clarity subset; so the ratings given to each of these variables (multiplied by their weightings) will together make up the clarity variable. These are as follows:

- Organization: 0.3
- Style: 0.3
- Table of Contents: 0.2
- Index: 0.2

_These are also subject to change._

^2: *It has been mentioned to me by Dr. William Donald on LinkedIn that there are certain aspects of a book’s clarity, such as the table of contents, are in control of the publisher rather than the author(s). It is useful to mention that the goal is to judge the work rather than the author, therefore it does not matter who is in control of the clarity.*

###### The Book’s Organization is Unclear
The matter of a book’s organization pertains to the separation of matter into discernible fragments (chapters and sections), it is about the book’s structure. A properly designed structure makes it far easier for readers to understand the themes and main ideas of the book.

A highly effective organization of a book: Each chapter or section is purposefully structured and contributes to a compelling narrative or argument. Transitions are seamless, maintaining a sense of continuity throughout the book. The organization strengthens the book's themes and aids reader comprehension, showcasing a thoughtful and deliberate approach.

###### The Style of the Book is not Suitable
Poor style: The author's writing style is completely inappropriate for the subject matter. The tone, language, and overall approach are misguided, confusing, or simply unrelated to the topic at hand. The writing lacks clarity, coherence, and fails to effectively convey the intended information or ideas.

Effective style: The author's writing style is exceptionally well-suited to the subject matter. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and effectively communicates complex ideas with clarity and precision. The language is engaging, compelling, and resonates with the intended audience. The writing style enhances the reader's comprehension, making the content accessible and enjoyable. It showcases a high level of skill and mastery in crafting prose specifically tailored to the subject matter.

###### The Table of Contents is Useless
The table of contents serves as a critical roadmap within a nonfiction book, influencing its evaluation. A missing or incomplete table reflects a lack of meaningful structure, leaving readers without a clear path through the content. Similarly, a disorganized table, with unclear headings and a haphazard structure, impedes effective navigation, diminishing the book's coherence.

Even when basic headings exist, criticism may arise if they lack definition or fail to categorize content effectively. In contrast, a well-structured table, with clear chapter and section headings, earns positive feedback. However, for optimal engagement, more descriptive subheadings may be needed. The pinnacle of success is an exceptionally well-constructed table that seamlessly integrates with the book's narrative, offering a logical and coherent structure, informative subheadings, and a user-friendly experience.

In essence, the evaluation of a book's table of contents is a reflection of its organization and accessibility. A well-crafted table enhances the overall reading experience, guiding readers effortlessly through the content and setting a standard of excellence rarely achieved.

###### The Index is Useless
The index of a book serves as a crucial guide for readers, and its evaluation can significantly impact the overall user experience. When the index is lacking or provides minimal, inaccurate, or irrelevant information, it fails to capture key concepts and terms, leaving readers struggling to navigate the content effectively.

An existing but disorganized index with inaccuracies and inconsistencies hampers readers' ability to find relevant information. Incomplete or poorly formatted entries create frustration and hinder the book's usability. Similarly, a partially functional index may fall short in providing comprehensive coverage, making it challenging for readers to locate specific information efficiently.

On a positive note, a decently organized index with a moderate level of coverage allows readers to find information with relative ease. However, occasional inaccuracies or inconsistencies can slightly impede its effectiveness. A well-structured and comprehensive index improves usability by offering clear and accurate entries, enhancing the overall reading experience.

The pinnacle of success is an exemplary index that sets the standard for excellence. Meticulously organized and flawlessly comprehensive, it captures every key concept, term, and reference with precision. The entries are logically arranged, making information retrieval effortless. Such an index becomes an invaluable tool, elevating the book's usability to an exceptional level and ensuring readers can easily access any desired information.

### Review
_Note: unless stated otherwise, this review is NOT written by the template author. Also, the sections for the review are sorted based on the weights given to them in the Appendix for easier comparison.  
In addition, part of the review are questions that Adler & van Doren give in the earlier stages (inspectional reading & the earlier stages of analytical reading) and not in the criticism section. The reason I decide to do this is because the answers to those questions are invaluable to both the community and your reviewing process._

_A lot of the wording and formatting is inspired by a template for reading I wrote a few months ago:_ [_https://matthew-van-der-hoorn.notion.site/matthew-van-der-hoorn/Book-Reading-bc745728387b4369b5b63739292c9ce7_](https://matthew-van-der-hoorn.notion.site/matthew-van-der-hoorn/Book-Reading-bc745728387b4369b5b63739292c9ce7) _(it is likely outdated when you read this, or even unavailable, but I find it worth mentioning, in addition, the criticism part of that template can be replaced with THIS document)._

_Everything between the following dividers is the review section, and can be copy/pasted into review sections on for example GoodReads, the Storygraph, or my favorite, LibraryThing. I would not advise to copy/paste the entire document unto there, but you can for example upload the document to Google Drive and share a link towards it for people interested in a more extended view._

_Without further ado, let’s review._

#### Questions from the Orientation Phase
1. **What is the overall structure and organization of the book?** Again, very broadly and briefly. Just to give a general sense.
Lorem ipsum.
2. **What are the main topics or themes discussed in the book?**
Lorem ipsum.
3. **What is the author's main argument or thesis?** State this briefly.
Lorem ipsum.
4. **What is the writing style or tone used by the author?**
Lorem ipsum.
5. **How would you classify the book?** This is not as straight forward as distinguishing fiction from non-fiction, but rather to distinguish multiple forms of expository works from each other (those that intend to convey knowledge).
    1. **Is this book theoretical or practical in nature?** Does it intend to tell you _how_ to do something, or _what_ is the case? Or is there a degree of both?
    2. **Is the book science, philosophy, history, or math, etc.?** Of course, there can be a degree of multiple, just like with theory vs practice.
    3. **Any other pigeonholes this book would fall into?**
Lorem ipsum.

#### Questions from the Conceptualization Phase
1. **What is the unity of the whole book?** Answer this as briefly as possible, at most a few sentences (short paragraph) — In other words, what is the book’s main theme or point? Comparable to the plot of a novel. Adler and van Doren mention that it’s often the case you will also mention the (major) parts while formulating the whole, as can be seen in below extended examples._You can almost see this as the formula of the book; Adler gives a romance example in the following way: Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl._
	_He also gives an example of a practical book, titled The Wealth of Nations, authored by Adam Smith:_
	This is an inquiry into the source of national wealth in any economy that is built on a division of labor, considering the relation of the wages paid labor, the profits returned to capital, and the rent owed the landowner, as the prime factors in the price of commodities. It discusses the various ways in which capital can be more or less gainfully employed, and relates to the origin and use of money to the accumulation and employment of capital. Examining the development of opulence in different nations and under different conditions, it compares the several systems of political economy, and argues for the beneficence of free trade.
	_An extended example for a theoretical scientific book he gives on Darwin’s The Origin of Species:_
	This is an account of the variation of living things during the course of countless generations and the way in which this results in new groupings of plants and animals; it treats both of the variability of domesticated animals and of variability under natural conditions, showing how such factors as the struggle for existence and natural selection operate to bring about and sustain such groupings; it argues that species are not fixed and immutable groups, but that they are merely varieties in transition from a less to a more marked and permanent status, supporting this argument by evidences from extinct animals found in the earth’s crust, and from comparative embryology and anatomy.
