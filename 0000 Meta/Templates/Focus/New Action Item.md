title: BEDS-M (Hint)
If you struggle to focus or struggle with procrastination, it is recommended to use Dr. Sung's BEDS-M system.

**Burn the Boats**: Set a consequence for failure of completing the task (unless an emergency breaks out obviously); ideally with an accountability partner. This consequence should be relatively severe so that you really don't want it.
**Environmental Optimization**: Remove distractions from the environment and set the environment up in such a way that it makes focusing easy.
**Distraction Sheet**: Keep a sheet closeby on which you write everything that distracts you (whether it is a thought, an interruption, etc.)... Then next time you can take this into account when optimizing your environment.
**Scheduling**: Make sure to prioritize tasks using the 10K framework (iCS recommends Eisenhower matrix, I do not); set out blocks of time in the calendar in which you do the task.
**Minimal Viable Goals**: You can trick your brain into doing hard things by making it insanely easy. For example, if you want to study for 4 hours, you start with the minimal viable goal of studying for 2 minutes, or even smaller, picking up the books -> putting them on the table in front of you -> opening them -> reading a sentence -> reading a paragraph -> etc. 
*The idea is to minimize the necessity of motivation and willpower as much as possible.*
