# [[What is Contained In this Vault]]

From the earlier parts of [[Welcome]] it is already logical that this vault contains a complete Life Operating System Vault... In other words a *CCPS-FLM* standing for Complete Comprehensive Powerful System For Life Management.

In all seriousness, this will mostly serve as a high-level overview into the different components of the system, which is useful because it is quite comprehensive.

```ad-attention
title: IMPORTANT
Use this as an *overview* into the system and as navigatory means **after** you have already done the core steps. Do not try to use this as a map **before** you have gone through the guiding steps as outlined in [[Welcome]]. This will cause confusion because the order might not be optimized.
```

```ad-caution
collapse: open
Due to the nature of the system, it is hard to make supplementary components truly *optional*; they are integrated into the system most of the time.

Still, I think it is valuable for me to write them here in a "compartmentalized" manner so you know what is optional. If you want to delete optional components, feel free to do so, but it will be a bit arduous.
```

## **CORE COMPONENTS:**
The primary components for the Life OS are Focus & Alignment, they serve as the pillars on which the entire system rests. Without this, there is no Life OS. From the supplementary components, you can pick & choose what you like/need, but these you cannot disregard.

*1) Alignment - Vision Oriented*
Main dashboard: [[Alignment Zone]]

The components for alignment, in order are (enumerated with supplementary processes):
- [[Guiding Principles]] || [[Figure out your True North]]
	- [[True North - Step 1) Reflection]]
	- [[True North - Step 2) Interpretation]]
	- [[True North - Step 3) Analysis]]
	- [[True North - Step 4) Formulate Guiding Principles]]
- [[Vision & Anti-Vision]] || [[Formulate your 100X Vision]]
- [[Value Goals]] || [[Decide upon your Goals]]

*2) Focus - Action Oriented* 
Main dashboard: [[Focus Zone]]

- **Goal Outcomes** || [[Decide upon your Goals]]
- **Projects & Processes** || [[Create a few starting Projects]] || [[All Processes Overview]]
- **Action Items** || These are visible in various locations within the system, most notably the [[Focus Zone]] and each project.

One of the components that does not fit necessarily in the strict hierarchy is the [[Schwerpunkt]], which mostly is an overview of the most important things RIGHT NOW. It is separated into several time-spans: weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and 100X 10 Year objectives. It is a way to quickly see what is most important right now, to keep in mind. 
	NOTE: This component depends quite a bit on the optional set of reflection components.

## **SUPPLEMENTARY COMPONENTS:**
*1) Reflection*
Out of all supplementary components, it is the least recommended you forego this one. Without proper reflective measure, it is nearly inevitable you lose track and sight of what is important, returning to a life of time and energy wasting.

Reflections are done in different recurring periods, each focusing on a different aspect/scope of the system (or your life)...

- **Daily** -- *Data Gathering* and Action-Oriented || [[New Daily Log]]
	- Additional: Sleep Tracking || [[New Sleep Log]]
	- Additional: System Usage || [[System Usage Log Template]]
- **Weekly** -- Primarily concerned with *action items* and *time* (where were inefficiencies in time spent, was everything related to the set objectives for the week) || [[New Weekly Review]]
- **Monthly** -- Mostly concerned with the *Projects* Scope, and a bit of goals. || [[New Monthly Review]]
- **Quarterly** -- Pertaining to *growth* most of all, as well as goals || [[New Quarterly Review]]
- **Yearly** -- || [[New Yearly Review]]

*2) Knowledge*
The knowledge component pertains to reading, thinking, Zettelkasten, etc.
