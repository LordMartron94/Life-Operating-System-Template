# [[Index of Background Concepts]]

This page serves as a collection of helpful background explainers... Yes they are linked where appropriate throughout the system, but I figured it would be helpful to have a single overview just as well.

## SYSTEM
For the main hierarchy of components in the system and why I chose to use this, see [[Narrowing Horizons as a System Design Principle]].

## ALIGNMENT

### Vision
To know why a vision is of the essence, take a look at [[The Importance of a Vision]]. If you want to know why I highly urge the formulation of "impossible" visions (and goals) rather than more manageable ones, see [[Why an Impossible Vision Trumps a Realistic Vision]].

To see how this relates to the future-self: [[Concept of the Future Self]].

See also the concept of [[Unique Ability]].

### Goals
To see the difference between SMART goals and 10x goals, and how we utilize the power of both in our Life Operating System, see: [[When to use SMART goals and when to use 10X goals]].

### Reflection
See [[The Need for Regular Reflection & Introspection]] in order to know why reflection is **essential** for proper life management.

## FOCUS
For the primary prioritization framework we use to see which tasks to do on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour basis, check out: [[The 10K Framework]].
