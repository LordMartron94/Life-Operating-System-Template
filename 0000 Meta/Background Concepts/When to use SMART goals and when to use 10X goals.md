# [[When to use SMART goals and when to use 10X goals]]

The system is built through different types of building blocks in the pipeline.

Actions are the building blocks of projects, projects are the building blocks of goals (along with habits/routines and reflection).

In the same way, SMART goals are the building blocks of 10X goals and both are in turn building blocks for your Value Goals. Your Value Goals build toward your vision, which ultimately pushes you in the direction of your True North, your ideal self.

10X goals are transformational and massive filters; they demand complete transformation of identity, belief, thought, mindset, and behavior in order to be achieved. You **must** step out of your comfort zone and into the growth zone (as [[Nishant Khasibatla]] would say) for them. They force you to *keep learning* at all stages.

10X Goals bring **MASSIVE SUCCESS** based on psychology, but they are also *intensive* albeit *simple*. Because of their intensive nature, it is recommended to work on not too many at a time. As a recommendation, work on one to three 10X goals at a time.

For the goal outcomes you have that are not 10X in nature they can be simply that, a goal outcome you work on. For 10X goal outcomes, you will separate them into shorter term SMART Goal Outcomes--they provide the big milestones towards achieving the 10X Goal Outcome.

So, in essence, longer term 10X goals are *broken down into more manageable SMART goals*, which in turn get broken down into projects (and habits/routines) and those into action items.

Lastly, 10X goals deserve careful analysis and thought to execute them well. Normal goal outcomes don't require that much attention upfront as they are less significant.
