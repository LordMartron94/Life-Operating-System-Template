# [[Rating a Book Fairly]]

This appendix will use the principles of reviewing a book to _calculate_ an objective rating for a book.

_Note: I have used ChatGPT to format most of the scripts in a format that is readable to save time._

The variables are as follows:
- Clarity: 0.3
- Logic: 0.3
- Misinformed: 0.15
- Analysis: 0.135
- Uninformed: 0.115

Now, some of these have a subset of variables that together make up the main variable. This allows for more nuanced and realistic calculations.

## Method
Each variable is assigned a list of options, usually there are 7 options, in some cases 4, it depends on the variable itself, and how much relevant granularity is possible. These are given points according to a Likert Scale where the worst is given -3 points, and the best 3 points. Within a 7 point scale, it is difficult to encounter a book that applies to either extreme, but just in case they are present. For a four point scale it is more probable to encounter a book on either extreme. When each variable within a subset is gathered they are calculated into a weighted average (the average of the summed weighted numbers), this number then represents the parent variable. When all main variables have either been calculated or gathered (some do not have a subset at this point in time), the data is normalized into a percentage of the maximally available point. The variables are then used to calculate a weighted average of those percentages, representing the total percentage of the bookâ€™s quality according to each variable. Lastly, the percentage is put into a scaling function to generate a rating between a custom minimum and maximum rating, in most cases this pertains to a number between 1 and 5.

Because of the high degree of granularity, it is very rare for any book to either have a 1 or 5 star rating.

I have used ChatGPT to give the explanations for each option to optimize my time. At a later version of both the document and my script/program, I will potentially edit or even redo the descriptions.

## Final Calculation

### Normalizing the Numbers
Since the Likert Data ranges from negative to positive, we want to normalize the data for easier calculation. We do this by adding 3 to each variable and then dividing by 6 to gain a percentage of the maximum value. Why 3? Because -3 + 3 = 0.

1. Clarity = (Clarity + 3) / 3
2. Logic = (Logic + 3) / 3
3. Misinformed = (Misinformed + 3) / 3
4. Analysis = (Analysis + 3) / 3
5. Uninformed = (Uninformed + 3) / 3
### Applying the Weights
- Clarity: 0.3
- Logic: 0.3
- Misinformed: 0.15
- Analysis: 0.135
- Uninformed: 0.115

For each of the main variables, apply their respective weights.
1. Clarity = Clarity * .3
2. Logic = Logic * .3
3. Misinformed = Misinformed * .15
4. Analysis = Analysis * .135
5. Uninformed = Uninformed * .115

### Interpreting the Numbers
We now want a single number to work with, so we sum the percentages to gain the weighted average of the rating percentage.
![[Pasted image 20240715184500.png]]

At this point, the rating is a percentage of the max rating possible. i.e., 0.7 (70%)

Lastly, we squish the percentage into the range of the minimum and maximum ratings. Usually the worst is 1 and the best 5.

MiV = Minimum Value (1)  
MaV = Maximum Value (5)  
V = Value (previous Rating)

![[Pasted image 20240715184511.png]]

For example:
![[Pasted image 20240715184522.png]]

In this scenario, the rating is: 3.5

This already shows that the rating calculation is very critical, and subjective to nuance. No more baseless 5 star ratings. Itâ€™s virtually impossible for a book to get a 5 star rating. Very good books will maybe get around the 4.3.
