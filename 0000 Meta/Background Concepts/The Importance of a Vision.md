# [[The Importance of a Vision]]
> When the *why* is strong enough, we can bear almost any *how.*

Based on [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]]'s concept of identity change and success, a vision is highly important because it is an elaborate expression of our future-self and thus helps massively in aligning our actions and thoughts with that of our future self.

Hardy argues that the only way to truly become who we want to become is to start acting and thinking like our future self. We need to determine what thoughts, beliefs, mindsets, etc., we need to have in the future to achieve what we want and then start acting like that.

Commonly, people think that the past is what defines them, but Hardy argues against this. He says it is the future that (should) defines us. Our present beliefs, thoughts, and perspectives give *meaning* to the past (in other words, how we think today determines the value or detriment of our past life) whilst our future dictates how we should live today. This helps us get into the productive mindset (the **invulnerable, invincible** mindset) that *everything happens **for** us rather than **to** us*.

Our vision in this way helps us become our guide by shining an initial light on what needs to be done. Anything that works against our vision, or even is neutral (does nothing to help us toward our vision) is detrimental and should be eliminated immediately. Obviously, this alone is not enough to gain massive success... But other strategies and tactics will be explained later on in the system.

Your vision and [[Unique Ability]] are also interrelated. By defining your vision, you get a better idea of what your unique ability is or what you want it to be, and by working on your unique ability, you gain better insight into what you want in the future and can thus mutate your vision along the way.
