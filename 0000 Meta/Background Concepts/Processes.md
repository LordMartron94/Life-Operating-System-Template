It's different from a project and also different from habits & routines. They are processes you need to get better at, which may involve doing projects or forming/breaking habits & routines. The primary way to get better at these processes is by doing marginal gains experiments (trying to get 1% better at the process consistently) and then reflecting on them using the Kolb's cycle.
