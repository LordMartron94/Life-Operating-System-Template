# [[The 10K Framework]]

The productivity expert and guru [[Khe Hy]] has developed a prioritization framework that, to my mind, works far better than the famous Eisenhower matrix; it is more sustainable in the long term. 

The framework is divided into sections based on *leverage* and *skill*. Leverage refers to the ratio of impact (an example of high leverage is an activity you do that brings progress in multiple projects or goals... Another example of high leverage is an activity that keeps working for you, brings benefits, after you have done it... For example setting something up that generates passive income). Skill obviously refers to the skill necessary to perform the task.

In the original framework, skill is determined *objectively*, i.e., doing a task that a specialist does (for example a lawyer or a programmer) is a task that is valued highly because it requires a lot of (unique) mastery, therefore it is considered high skill.

To make the 10K framework more compatible with the 10X concept by [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]] as outlined in [[10X is Easier than 2X]], and with growth in general, I have made the decision to have skill be determined *subjectively* and *dynamically*. In other words, high-skill activities are those that are (far) beyond your current skill level in that particular area, and low-skill activities are those you have already mastered. 

It is recommended to spend most of your time in high-leverage, high-skill activities. Those that require less skill are best delegated to others or forfeited in general.

This way, you always try to spend time doing the things you have not yet fully mastered and thus keep being in a perpetual state of growth.

$10K work is *high-skill, high-leverage*
$1k work is *low-leverage, high-skill*
$100 work is *high-leverage, low-skill*
$10 work is *low-leverage, low-skill*

Ideally, spend your time in the 1-10k range. Sometimes doing $100 work is necessary to set up systems and workflows in order to free up future time for doing more 1-10k work.
