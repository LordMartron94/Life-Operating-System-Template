# [[Narrowing Horizons as a System Design Principle]]

There are several horizons to think about life, and work. In "[[Getting Things Done]]", [[David Allen]] describes 6. 

1. **Ground**: The actions you must take on an hour-to-hour, day-by-day basis.
2. **Projects**: Groups of actions you must take.
3. **Areas**: Areas of Life that are important to you.
4. **Goals and Objectives**: The goals and objectives you want to achieve in the medium to long term.
5. **Vision**: What you want to have achieved in the long term.
6. **Purpose and Principles**: The core of who you are and what your work is.

Each of these horizons pertain to a different level of scope when it comes to managing your life, from the minute to the grand, big picture. You could say they *move on a spectrum of strategy*; strategy (long-term), tactics (medium/short-term), operational (executive, in the moment).

In our system we start with the broadest horizon (purpose & principles) and work our way down to the most precise one (action items). The reason for this is that what we do on a day-to-day basis should be derived from our principles and vision; it must work toward what we want in life. We do not necessarily use all horizons from GTD.

This way of thinking provides a useful measure of productivity as well; how much have we done each day that truly moves the needle toward our ambitions, and how much aligns with our core principles and future identity.
