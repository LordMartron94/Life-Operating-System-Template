# [[Unique Ability]]

According to [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]], your *unique ability* is the skill, or set of skills, that are uniquely yours; not only do you have a high degree of mastery in it (or want to get a high degree of mastery), but also are you unique in *how* you do it.

You always want to keep improving in this area and seek opportunity to do so.

Most importantly, you are *intrinsically motivated* to do this, you are most of the time, if not always, in a state of energy and engagement. This is when you are mostly in flow.

Another word for your Unique Ability could be your *calling* -- It's an expression of your life's purpose... Your life's work. If you won't do it, nobody else will. Additionally, the expression of your Unique Ability will change and refine over time, as you gain more and more mastery, as you continue to 10X yourself.

Your Unique Ability is *how* you play your own game, by your own rules... Nobody else can compare to this or compete with you, as nobody is you. You do this *uniquely well*. True mastery.

As Hardy said in the book *10X is Easier than 2X*:

A word of warning when it comes to definining your Unique Ability. It's much. much bigger than anything you specifically do. More directly, your Unique Ability is the unique way you approach what you do when you're living at your best. It's not tied to any specific activity, although you can frame it that way strategically and thoughtfully if you'd like.
There's danger in defining your Unique Ability based on a specific skill, such as writing. 10x jumps often require a great evolution in your Unique Ability, so you want to avoid putting yours in a box.
...
It's best to chunk your Unique Ability beyond any finite game to the higher and more infinite game--which is beyond context or any specific activity. This is you at your essence, and what you're ultimately doing beneath any specific activity. In this way, I may define my Unique Ability as, "Connecting with truth, internalizing and being transformed by it, and teaching it in such a way that it transforms those who hear it."
