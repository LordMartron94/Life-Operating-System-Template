My ideal way of scheduling is a hybrid between rigid time-blocking and fluid task management. 

I make use of [[The 10K Framework]] its quadrants for time-blocking. I have recurring timeblocks set up each week at the same time. For example (not real) I could have a block of 10k work Monday from 8am to 12pm and a block for 1k work on Monday from 1pm to 3pm on Monday. Then, every evening in the [[New Daily Log||Daily Log]], I select the tasks for the following day, these are the tasks I want to have completed the next day. During the day, I go through my planned action list of the day (see [[Focus Zone]]) and do the activities that correspond to the quadrant for that time period. Using the previous example, from 8am to 12pm I would do tasks corresponding to 10k work, and from 1pm to 3pm I would do tasks corresponding to 1k work.

In the case where I am done with all corresponding quadrant tasks for that timeblock before the time is done, I can do three things depending on how I feel:
**A)** Relax (i.e., play a game, watch something, etc.)
**B)** Continue with other tasks planned for the day, regardless of 10K quadrant.
**C)** Select extra tasks corresponding to this quadrant from the next-up list (the large database with tasks that need to completed at some time in the future).

That said, with the way the calendar is currently set up in the [[Focus Zone]], it's impossible to have the recurring time-blocks setup in this manner, which is a bummer. So until I have come around to fixing this, I might just use Google Calendar still as my preferred way for timeblocking and use the Focus Zone's calendar only for a broad task overview as I did in Notion.
