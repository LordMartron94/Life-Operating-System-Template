# [[Concept of the Future Self]]

As explained by [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]] in [[10X is Easier than 2X]], the future self is very important when it comes to goal setting. In order to achieve impossible goals, it's very important to start acting as our future self.

The only way for us to achieve our vision, to fulfill our calling (or our Ulterior Purpose as [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] would call it) is to act as our future self, not in the future, but **now**.
[[Bob Proctor]] also said this a lot; the only way to become rich or wealthy is to start acting like a rich and wealthy person. By acting like someone who is poor or even average, you stay poor or average. The definition of insanity is to do the same things over and over again yet expect a different result.

We need to *bridge the gap between our present beliefs, thoughts, behaviors and our future beliefs, thoughts, behaviors...* Our future self has much clearer standards and goals, much better definitions of success. The more we can imagine and visualize our future self their standards and success definition, the more we can align us with out future self and therefore be closer to our "ideal".

> When the *why* is strong enough, we can bear almost any *how.*
