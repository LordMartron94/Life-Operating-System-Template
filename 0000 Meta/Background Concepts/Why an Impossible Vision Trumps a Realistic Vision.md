# [[Why an Impossible Vision Trumps a Realistic Vision]]

In the realm of personal and professional development, there's a common misconception that setting "realistic" goals is the key to success. However, according to [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]] in _[[10X is Easier than 2X]]_, this couldn't be further from the truth. Hardy argues that aiming for the seemingly impossible, the 10X vision, is actually a more effective strategy than pursuing incremental, 2X goals.

The problem with "realistic" goals is that they often keep us confined within our existing knowledge and assumptions. They don't challenge us to think outside the box or explore uncharted territories. As a result, we tend to rely on familiar methods and strategies, leading to incremental progress at best.

On the other hand, impossible goals, or 10X goals, force us to break free from our current limitations. They compel us to question our assumptions, seek out new information, and develop innovative solutions. By their very nature, 10X goals demand a complete transformation of our thinking and approach, opening up a world of possibilities that were previously unimaginable.

In essence, the pursuit of impossible goals is *not about achieving the exact numerical target*. **It's about the journey of personal and professional growth that unfolds along the way**. By striving for what seems unattainable, *we unlock our hidden potential, expand our capabilities, and ultimately achieve far more than we ever thought possible*. So, dare to dream big, set those impossible goals, and watch as you surpass your own expectations and achieve extraordinary results.

Bigger, impossible, goals and visions *force* us to let go of the 80% that does not help any longer. It ensures we keep learning and growing, both as a person and as an expert in our field. We constantly evolve our expression of our [[Unique Ability]] by going 10X or even 100X on our vision and goals.
