# [[Meaning of Statistical Data]]

## Correlation Coefficient:
> **Correlation Coefficient:** This number (between -1 and 1) tells us how strongly time in bed and sleep score are related.
> 
> - A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship (more x usually means a higher y).
> - A value close to -1 means a strong negative relationship (more x usually means a lower y).
> - A value close to 0 suggests there's little to no linear relationship.
## Observations:
> **Observations:** This is the number of data points (entries) used in our analysis. More observations generally give us a more reliable picture of the relationship.

## Direction:
> **Direction:** This tells us whether the relationship is positive (both variables tend to increase together) or negative (one variable increases while the other decreases).

## Strength:
> **Strength:** This describes how closely the data points follow a straight line. "Very high correlation" means the relationship is almost perfectly linear, while "no correlation" means there's no clear linear pattern.

## Function by Linear Regression (Least Squares):
> **Function by Linear Regression (Least Squares):** This equation (`y = mx + b`) represents the line that best fits our data. We can use it to predict sleep scores based on time in bed.
> 
> - `x` is the x.
> - `y` is the predicted y.
> - `m` (slope) tells us how much the y changes for each additional unit of x.
> - `b` (intercept) is the predicted y when x is zero.

## Error (Root Mean Squared Error):
> **Error (Root Mean Squared Error):** This measures the average difference between the predicted y (from our equation) and the actual y. A lower value means our predictions are generally more accurate.

## X (Mean ± Std Dev):
> **X (Mean ± Std Dev):** This shows the average x (`Mean`) and how much individual entries typically deviate from that average (`Std Dev`). For example, "8.25 ± 1.15 hours" means the average is 8 hours and 15 minutes, but it's common for entries to vary by about 1 hour and 9 minutes.

## Y (Mean ± Std Dev):
> **Y (Mean ± Std Dev):** This is the same concept for y. It shows the average y and how much individual scores tend to fluctuate around that average.

## R-squared:
> **R-squared:** This number (between 0 and 1) tells us how well our linear model (the equation) explains the changes in y.
> 
> - An R-squared of 1 means the model perfectly predicts y based on x.
> - An R-squared of 0 means the model doesn't explain any of the variation in y.
> - In our case, an R-squared of 0.7225 means that 72.25% of the variation in y can be explained by x (the remaining 27.75% is due to other factors).


## P-Value
>**P-value (approximate):** This value (between 0 and 1) indicates the probability of observing a relationship as strong as or stronger than the one we found, purely by chance, if there were actually no real relationship between time in bed and sleep score.
> 	A very small p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) suggests it's unlikely the relationship is due to random chance alone, and thus strengthens the evidence for a real association between x and y.
