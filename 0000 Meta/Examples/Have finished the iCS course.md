## Goal Anchoring
The first step in the creation of an outcome goal is to anchor it, to define it adequately.
The goal should be SMART.
```ad-info
title: SMART
collapse: closed
**S**pecific
**M**easurable
**A**chievable
**R**ealistic
**T**imebound
```

Because the iCS course is an amazing resource for learning.
