## Goal Anchoring
The first step in the creation of an outcome goal is to anchor it, to define it adequately.
The goal should be SMART.
```ad-info
title: SMART
collapse: closed
**S**pecific
**M**easurable
**A**chievable
**R**ealistic
**T**imebound
```

Lorem ipsum (write here).

---

Because this is a **10X** goal, now disregard the achievable & realistic parts of SMART and 100X the goal, and also lengthen the timespan to *3 years* at a minimum.

```ad-example
collapse: open
BASIC:
**Original**: Have sold 10,000 copies of my book by 2025 (in one year)
**10X**: Have sold 100,000 copies of my book by 2025 (in one year)

ADVANCED:
**Original**: Have sold 10,000 copies of my book by 2025 (in one year)
**100X**: Have sold 100,000,000 copies of my book by 2035 (in ten years)
```

### Why this Goal?
%% Paste this into the `why this goal` field in the metadata. %%
*In this section you shall answer why you have this goal outcome... Why is it important to you? Why is it relevant? How does this help you become who you want to become? What values of yours does it serve? How significant is the goal? Is it important at all?*

Lorem ipsum (write here).

##### Value Goals

##### Guiding Principles
![[Guiding Principles]]



## Goal Determination
*How much input-time will it likely require to accomplish this goal? Something can take many months, but only a minimal amount of time to invest on a day-to-day, week-to-week, basis—this is what I am talking about here.*

Lorem ipsum (write here).

## Goal Analysis (Goal Dissection)
%% This step and those below should only be filled in when the goal becomes active; when you start working on it. Doing this beforehand will be a waste of time and energy. %%

*This section is based on [[Dr. Justin Sung's iCanStudy Course]] and the future-self concept by [[Dr. Benjamin Hardy]] as described in [[10X is Easier than 2X]].*

### Visualization Framework / Reflection 
> **All progress starts by telling the truth!**

**DESIRED COMMITMENT:** [[Have created a learning system based on a couple hundred sources by July 2030]]

>[!important]
>First, fill in the *step 1* section of each category... Then fill in each step 2 backwardly.
>In other words:
>1. Reflection of each category; forward order (past-based)
>2. Premeditation of each category; backward order (future-based)

#### Goal-Conflicting Actions or Inactions
**Step 1) Reflection**
*What are your current behaviors and processes which limit the success of the goal? In other words: what do you currently do or NOT do hindering your progress toward this commitment? What activities are you currently spending time on that do not directly contribute to your 10x goal? Are there tasks you're avoiding that could significantly impact your progress?*
- 

**Step 2) Premeditation**
*What behaviors and processes must you take and become adequate in so that you achieve your commitment? What new habits or routines do you need to establish to support your 10x goal? What skills or knowledge do you need to acquire to make this goal achievable?* 
- 
---
#### Hidden Commitments of my Former Self
**Step 1) Reflection**
*What are your current commitments and identities which limit the progress toward your goal? What things are part of your current identity that will hinder your progress? What aspects of your current identity or commitments are holding you back from pursuing this 10x goal? Are there any past successes or failures that are influencing your current mindset and limiting your potential?*
- 

**Step 2) Premeditation**
*What commitments must you make and what standards must you have in order to achieve this goal? What new commitments do you need to make to yourself to fully embrace this 10x goal? What standards do you need to set for yourself to ensure you're consistently moving towards this goal?*
- 
---
#### Limiting Beliefs or Assumptions
**Step 1) Reflection**
*What are some of your current assumptions and beliefs (thoughts you trust to be true) that stand in the way of achieving the desired commitment? What beliefs or assumptions are you holding onto that are making this 10x goal seem impossible or unrealistic? Are there any self-limiting beliefs that are preventing you from taking the necessary risks or actions?*
- 

**Step 2) Premeditation**
*What beliefs, assumptions and mindsets must you adopt so that you can achieve this goal? What new beliefs or mindsets do you need to adopt to make this 10x goal feel achievable and exciting? What empowering beliefs will help you overcome obstacles and setbacks along the way?*
- 

### Required Processes
*Based on the reflection and visualization: for each process required, open it up and load the template for the Evaluation & Marginal Gains Experimentation.*

Use the [[All Processes Overview]] page to find pre-existent processes that might be related.

**Do not activate processes here. You want to do that only in the [[Alignment Zone]] because you need a clear overview of all processes before doing this.**

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
status AS "Status",
file.link AS "Process",
goal-outcomes AS "Goal Outcome(s)",
category AS "Category",
level AS "Level",
easier-harder AS "Easier/Harder Summary",
how-it-went AS "How it Went Summary",
significance AS "Significance"

SORT significance ASC

## Premeditation | Barrier Detection
> *This section is meant primarily to prepare for barriers. Detect the walls before you hit them. It allows you to divert your direction around them, or to bring tools in order to crush them.*

### TIME
#### Time Availability
*How much time do I have available for this goal? Be honest and detailed.*
- 
#### Time Protection
*What am I going to do to protect my time? It must be specific and actionable, no vague intentions.*
- 
### LIMITING HABITS
*What are some of my habits that could potentially get in the way of my goal? Be honest and detailed.*
- 
#### Scripted Actions
*For each limiting habit, come up with a scripted action to counteract it. Refine as needed, but first be consistent with applying it.*
- 
#### Environmental Optimizations
*What are some optimizations I can do to the environment in order to counteract the limiting habit? Remember the Habit Cycle (Cue → Craving → Response → Reward) ⇒ Make it invisible, undesirable, difficult, unsatisfying)*
-
