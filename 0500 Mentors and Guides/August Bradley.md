August Bradley is one of the foundational mentors I have had for the creation of this Life Operating System. Back in 2020, when I first learned about *true productivity*, his PPV (Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults) system in Notion was truly eye-opening and transformational. For the longest time (roughly 4-5 years) I have used that system, continuously adapting it with my own readings and learned knowledge, until I found it became time to create something of my own.

I will forever be grateful to August Bradley, the man, the myth, the legend. Without him, I could not have become as knowledgeable in the creation of systems and productivity as I am now.

August Bradley is a renowned expert in personal performance enhancement and optimization, leveraging the power of science, systems, psychology, and technology to transform lives and businesses. With a proven track record of building three successful companies and advising numerous high-performance tech ventures, August has developed a unique set of methodologies. These internal technologies and operational systems are designed to create exceptionally lean and effective operations, reducing stress and chaos while providing a frictionless foundation for growth.

August's approach to modern tools in small businesses goes beyond traditional IT projects or business systems overhauls. He emphasizes the critical human aspect of optimizing habits, routines, and personal capabilities, recognizing that in smaller firms, the lives of the owners are deeply intertwined with their businesses. Therefore, business system advancements must be accompanied by the optimal performance of the leaders, allowing both to grow in parallel.

His life journey is a testament to his philosophy. Despite facing significant challenges, August excelled in the Harvard Business School MBA program, overcame a life-threatening health condition to achieve top percentile fitness, and developed a mindfulness practice to manage anxiety and attention deficit challenges. His dedication to personal growth and performance is further evidenced by his success in reversing excessive weight gain through well-designed nutritional protocols and his continuous experimentation with quantified-self tools and techniques.

Today, August shares his discoveries and techniques with others, helping individuals and businesses reboot their lives and operations to achieve elite performance with soaring personal and financial results. His comprehensive program is a culmination of his knowledge of best-in-class systems, technology, and personal experiences, aimed at those who feel stuck and aspire to reach their full potential. August Bradley's expertise and guidance have been instrumental to many, including those who have built their own productivity systems based on his pioneering work.
