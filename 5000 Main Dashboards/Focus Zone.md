## üìÜ CALENDAR
*In the future I will add the possibility for recurrence into the calendar as this is my preferred way of scheduling. [[Ideal Scheduling Method]]*

Note: sometimes, the calendar event pop up does not work because it does not create the DO Date end property correctly. I have no idea why this is yet, you have to manually fix this either in the event note itself or by `right click -> edit event -> correct do date end -> save`. I will try to fix this in the future.
```dataviewjs 
delete global.require.cache[global.require.resolve(app.vault.adapter.basePath + "/0000 Meta/JavaScript/dataviewLib.js")];

const dataviewLib = require(app.vault.adapter.basePath + "/0000 Meta/JavaScript/dataviewLib.js");

const { renderCalendar } = app.plugins.plugins["obsidian-full-calendar"]; 

const calendarLib = new dataviewLib.CalendarLib(dv, "/0000 Meta/JavaScript");

const eventsArray = await calendarLib.getEvents("3000 Core Pipelines/Action Items", "rgb(117, 117, 117)", false, "DO Date");

this.container.style.minHeight = "500px"; 

const calendar = renderCalendar(this.container, [eventsArray]);

calendar.setOption('eventChange', await calendarLib.eventChange);
calendar.setOption('eventClick', await calendarLib.eventClick);
calendar.setOption('eventMouseEnter', await calendarLib.eventMouseEnter);

calendar.render();
```
