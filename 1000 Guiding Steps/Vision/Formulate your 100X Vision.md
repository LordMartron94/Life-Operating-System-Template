# [[Formulate your 100X Vision]]
< Previous Step: [[True North - Step 4) Formulate Guiding Principles|Guiding Principles Development]] | Next Step: [[Decide upon your Goals|Goal Setting]] >

Now that we have our *Guiding Principles* (for reference: [[Guiding Principles]]) it is time to build our vision and anti-vision. It is absolutely **crucial** that we spend a good amount of time to define these things and formulate it in such a way that it keeps on inspiring us, keeps the fire burning (it needs to be *emotional*). Your vision will be the primary influence on the actionable pipelines within the system. 

In other words:
> [!important]
> Your Vision will influence your Goals, Projects, and Tasks in the most significant way. 
> Having a badly defined vision, therefore, will drastically hamper your ability to work on your future.
> **Your Vision is the definition of your Future Self.**

<span style="color:rgb(148, 148, 148)">Take a look at your guiding principles now, and maybe go over the reflections done in the previous section too (</span>[[True North - Step 1) Reflection|1) Reflection]], [[True North - Step 2) Interpretation|2) Interpretation]], [[True North - Step 3) Analysis|3) Analysis]]<span style="color:rgb(148, 148, 148)">). Based upon all this metaknowledge of yourself, formulate a vision you have of the future in a few paragraphs. </span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Really spend time and effort thinking about this, be as detailed as possible, but also include a concise summary of your vision. </span> 

Some prompts to help you think about what to put in your vision:
**Vision and Unique Ability**
1. Who do you want to spend time with and why?
2. What would you do in an ideal day or week, or even a month or year?
3. What amount of time do you spend working on your Unique Ability?
4. What does your Unique Ability look like at that point in time?
5. What kind of environment do you live in? Describe your home, your neighborhood, and the natural surroundings.
**Legacy and Contribution**
6. What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind? What do you want people to remember you for?
7. What contributions do you make to your community or society at large? How are you involved in social, environmental, or charitable activities?
 **Personal Growth and Learning**
8. What kind of learning and growth do you continuously pursue? What skills, knowledge, or experiences are you eager to acquire?
**Balance and Relationships**
9. How do you balance personal and professional life? What boundaries do you set to ensure harmony and fulfillment in both areas?
10. What kind of relationships do you have with your family, friends, and colleagues? How do you nurture and maintain these relationships?
 **Achievements and Creativity**
11. What milestones or achievements are you most proud of? How do these reflect your values and guiding principles?
12. What role does creativity and innovation play in your life? How do you foster and express your creative side?
 **Giving and Receiving**
13. What does a perfect balance between giving and receiving look like for you? How do you contribute to others while also taking care of your own needs?
*These serve as guidelines and do not all need to be incorporated.*

I recommend to have your vision be 30 years into the future. If you have trouble thinking that far ahead, go for a minimum of 10 years. A vision is supposed to be long term.

**Your vision is not set in stone and will mutate as you live on and reflect.**

> [!important]
> Be realistic at first, and then make the vision "impossible"... 100X the vision. 
> 
> If an aspect of your vision is to have a million dollars worth of net worth, make it 100 million dollars. If an aspect of your vision is to have impacted positively a city within your area of expertise, make it the whole word. 
> 
> **100X qualitatively, not quantitatively**

## Vision

Now that you have written your vision, copy it and paste it in [[Vision & Anti-Vision]] (in the vision section). This is to make sure the vision appears in the appropriate other components of the systems when necessary.

The next step is to define our anti-vision, the future we want to AVOID at all costs. A concept I got from [[Dan Koe]].  Your anti-vision is basically everything you want to *avoid* in life. Write it in such a way that it gets you **angry** every time you read it (metaphorically). 

As you write your anti-vision, feel free to mutate your vision where applicable.

When you assess your week, you can compare your actions and behavior to whether it moved the needle toward your vision or anti-vision, or if it was neutral.

```ad-important
Spend a decent amount of time and energy expressing your anti-vision.

```

Prompts:
1. What do you NOT want to achieve in life?
2. What do you NOT want to do on a day-to-day basis?
3. Who do you NOT want to be?
4. Who do you NOT want to spend time with?
## Anti-Vision

Once again, write this in the [[Vision & Anti-Vision]] under the anti-vision section.
