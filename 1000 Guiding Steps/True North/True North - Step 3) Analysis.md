Looking over the answers to the previous steps — what does that say about me? What insights can I extract from that about what I value and where I find meaning in life?

Really mine these actual experiences for discoveries. What we do says a lot about ourselves that may not be obvious. Study the behaviors and observe the subsequent feelings/emotions following that behavior.

1. Describe the **patterns** you see in your past experiences, actions, and interactions. What are the recurring elements that reappear over and over again? Probe this deeply, spend hours or even days reflecting on this (and make it a habit in life to watch for such patterns on an ongoing basis). These can be positive or negative patterns.

	Skim the reflections listed in the [[True North - Step 1) Reflection|reflection]] section and see if any more of those reveal patterns to add to the list above.
	
	...then put an asterix (\*) next to those listed above that are feedback loops, meaning they get stronger and stronger, building over time (the output from one loop pours even greater strength into the beginning of the next iteration).

2. Is there a difference between how you feel about these recurring patterned actions and events in the moment, immediately afterward, or after some time has passed?
    
    Pay attention to where the subsequent feelings were positive, where they were negative, and where they changed over time (if they did not change, no problem — don't force it).
    
    Organize the list in #1 above plus any others from the [[True North - Step 1) Reflection|reflection]] and [[True North - Step 2) Interpretation|interpretation]] sections onto the following linked page with these four category headings.
