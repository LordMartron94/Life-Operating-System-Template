# [[Figure out your True North]]

The first step in the process of managing your life is to figure out what your drive is. Your purpose. Your motivation.

( See also: [[The Need for Regular Reflection & Introspection]] )

[[August Bradley]] has a powerful reflective process developed for this. I have separated these into different steps and chunks. Modified as well based on my own readings and expertise.

## Conceptual Approach
If you don't know what you value, study how you spend your time — what you gravitate toward naturally. Then assess how you feel afterward.
- Was it rewarding?
- Do you feel grateful?
- Do you feel indifferent?
- Do you feel regret?
- How could you have spent that time better?

This afterglow reveals a great deal about what you value.

> “The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it's hostile, but that it's indifferent. If we can come to terms with this indifference, then our existence as a species can have genuine meaning. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.” - <span style="color:rgb(148, 148, 148)">Stanley Kubrick</span> 

We must create our own meaning.
Meaning comes from responsibility.
No responsibility, no meaning, no purpose.

Want meaning and purpose? Accept responsibility for things that make a difference.

Use what you know about your values to choose your responsibilities. Put yourself in a position where other people can depend on you. Then don't let them down. Over-deliver.

This does not mean ignore yourself or your own needs. You need to build yourself as well so you have the strength and resources to deliver on your purpose.
